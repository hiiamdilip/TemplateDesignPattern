# TemplateDesignPattern

It falls under behaviroal design pattern.

It allows to define a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithm's structure.

1) Used to create a group of sub classes that have to execute a similar group of methods.
2) We can create an abstract class that contains the method called the template method.
3) The template method contains a series of methods calls that every subclass object will call.
4) The sub class object can override some of the method calls.
